Data Analysis Class - 10/2/2017

Introduction:
  Around 40 people in the class, varied set of backgrounds, most people already working and looking to expand their skillsets.  A few poeple wanting to pivot, or looking for a new career. Several people mentioned being in positions where they are "swimming in data" and need to have more skills in order to unblock themselves. Also several people who are not specifically in Analytic roles, but who have to do analysis as parts of their day-to-day lives.
  
Course Requirements: (3 books)
  - Statistics in a Nutshell
  - What is a P-Value Anyway?
  - R for Data Science
  
Class overview:
- 10 weeks of clss
- Think about projects to do with skills from this class
- There is a final project (can be done individually)

Changes in Market Trends
- Historically, it was enough to do retrospective analysis to figure out "what happened"
- Now however, companies would like to be able to predict what will happen in the futore and make recommendations

Data Anlytics Tool Box:
- R and Python
- SQL
- Machine learning

(Train and retrain models continuously)

Excel exercise:
- Seatmate is named "Barb"

R Statistical Programming Language
- Similar to MatLab
- More mature for statistical analysis than Python, but Python is catching up

Data Mining to Machine Learning

Supervised learning : regression and classification

Unsupervised learning: clusterning

Linear regression
Logistic regressions
Decision trees
Vector machines
Neural Networks

Overview of the Iterative Data Analysis Process:
  Ask questions > Wrangle Data > Explore Data > Draw conclusion > Communicate findings
  
Ask Questions:
  Why did sales rise in the past few years?
  
Wrangle data:
  Examples of data types that need to be wrangled:
    Dates
    Currency
    No-data

Excel work: (Use vehicle data provided in class)
  Which car is most efficient
  Are any of the variables related to each other

----------------

Class 2: Intro to Graphical Data Anlysis

- Recap of Day 1:

Sometimes you don't go through all of the Data Analysis steps.  You might stop at the Data Exploration or even Wrangling step because you find that your data is no good.

- R: made of packages, only comes with a few basic ones

- To install:
  install.packages("package name")

- To use/load a package:
  library(<package>)
(equivalent to "import" statement in Python) loads package into memory

- Alternate way to call function:
  package_name::function_name()

- To control the size of a plot, use the repr package:
  library(repr)
  options(repr.plot.width=4, repr.plot.height=4)

- To select a subset of rows with a matching condition, use the filter() command.
  filter(mpg, cyl == 5)
This selects the cars in the data set that have 5 cylinders


--------------------
LESSON 3: 10/16/2017
--------------------

- Project Goals:
Question, Data Set, Team/Self, 3-7 pg. Powerpoint
Talk about all 5 stages
Top 3 problems you found and solved
Presentation peer rating

- Factors are an very interesting concept.  Let's you create classes that can be numerically compared to one-another.
  my_class <- as_factor(mpg$class)

- Regression in R: (INstructor segway)
my_model <- lm(mpg~., data=mpg)

Gets linear relationship between mpg and all other variables

- How to read CSV files:
    read_csv() which is part of tidyverse::readr
    read_tsv() for tab-separated values
    read_delim() for custom delimiter text files
(There is also a read.csv() function that is part of the base R install)

- How to write out files:
    write_csv()
    write_tsz()
    write_excel()

-----------------------------
Lesson 4: Data Transformation
-----------------------------
Review of last week's homework:
- months as factor, they can cycle as in month 1 of this year versus month 1 of next year
- No easy way to numerically compare observations with factors, and sometimes you want to (ie number of bedrooms)
- In the class exercise, the ID field could be removed, since a random unique identifier is not really needed to do the data analysis.

- str_detect(data, <regex>): works by creating a vector index of all the positions within a string that match the regular expression.

ERD: (Entity relation Diagram) shows relationship between several DB tables

"Slowly changing dimensions": track movement and changes in data (need to look this up)

------------------------------
Lesson 5: Data Transformation
------------------------------
- Bargaining for team leads - no thanks!
- Went over the class project
- Yes/No question is a type of A/B test where you evaluate which option is best, A or B
- Everything related to obeservation is stored in a single row in Statistically normalized  data
- Loops can usually be converted into vectorized operations which are faster

- Look up "star schema"

---------------------
Lesson 6: Statistics
---------------------
- "inferential" just means that you're working with a sample
- histogram breaks up values into buckets or bins
- The longer the tail, the more the ditribution is skewed in that direction
- Look up how to calculate an absolute value  (square-root of squared values)
- Variance is looking at the sum of the differences between a specific point and the mean
- What the hell is "Mean Absolute Deviation"?
The steps to find the MAD include:
1. find the mean (average)
2. find the difference between each data value and the mean
3. take the absolute value of each difference
4. find the mean (average) of these differences
- KNN Classifier (Nearest Neighbor)

- P value less than 5% is what we want, otherwise it indicates that variable is not meaningful
