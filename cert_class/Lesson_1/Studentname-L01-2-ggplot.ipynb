Control + Enter is a keyboard shortcut for this that you are encouraged to try too. To use this keyboard shortcut, click the cell to select it. A green border appears around the cell block. Then hold down the control key and while it is still held down, press the Enter key. Let both keys go. No offense meant for all you keyboard shortcut folks out there. \n",

For now we will start simple with what is often referred to in the coding world as the \"Hello, World\" program for ggplot, meaning it is the simplest working program that we can build on to make more sophisticated ones.\n",
